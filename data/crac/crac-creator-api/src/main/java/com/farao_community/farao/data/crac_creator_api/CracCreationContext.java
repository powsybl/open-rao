 *  Common interface of a Crac creation context
 *
 *  A CracCreationContext contains the results of a CRAC creation, notably the created Crac
 *  object.
 *
 *  It also contains additional information on how the {@link Crac} has been created from a
 *  {@link NativeCrac}, for instance on how the object of the NativeCrac has been mapped in
 *  the created Crac.
 *
 *  The CracCreationContext is notably required by some Crac exporters, so as to rollback
 *  some of the Crac information with their native values.
