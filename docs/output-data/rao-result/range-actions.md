These results contain information about the selection of standard range actions by the RAO.  
Standard range actions are range actions that have a continuous set-point that can be optimised in a given range.  
Actually, standard range actions handled by OpenRAO are: **HVDC range actions** and **Injection range actions**.  
*Note that you will need to use [RangeAction](/input-data/crac/json.md#range-actions) objects from the CRAC for querying the Java API.*

### PST range actions results

These results contain information about the application of PST range actions by the RAO.  
PSTs are not standard range actions, because they have integer tap positions; a few extra methods in the API allow
querying the tap positions. All "set-point" methods of standard range actions also can also be used.    
*Note that you will need to use [PstRangeAction or RangeAction](/input-data/crac/json.md#pst-range-action) objects from the CRAC for querying the Java API.*
