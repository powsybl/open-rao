The instant is a moment in the chronology of a contingency event. Four instants kinds currently exist in FARAO:
- the **preventive** instant kind occurs before any contingency, and describes the "base-case" situation. A CRAC may 
  contain only one instant of kind preventive.
- the **outage** instant kind occurs just after a contingency happens, in a time too short to allow the activation of any
  curative remedial action. A CRAC may contain only one instant of kind outage.
- the **auto** instant kind occurs after a contingency happens, and spans through the activation of automatic curative 
  remedial actions ("automatons") that are triggered without any human intervention. These automatons are pre-configured 
  to reduce some constraints, even though they can generate constraints elsewhere in the network. A CRAC may contain any 
  number of instants of kind auto.
- the **curative** instant kind occurs after a contingency happens, after enough time that would allow the human activation
  of curative remedial actions. A CRAC may contain any number of instants of kind auto.

The FARAO object model includes the notion of "state". A state is either:

- the preventive state: the state of the base-case network, without any contingency, at the preventive instant.
- the combination of a given contingency with instant outage, auto or curative: the state of the network after the said
  contingency, at the given instant (= with more or less delay after this contingency).

The scheme below illustrates these notions of instant and state. It highlights the combinations of the situations which can be described in a CRAC, with a base-case situation, but also variants of this situation occurring at different moments in time after different probable and hypothetical contingencies.

States are not directly added to a FARAO CRAC object model; they are implicitly created by business objects
that are described in the following paragraphs ([CNECs](#cnecs) and [remedial actions](#remedial-actions)).

Instants are added one after the other in the CRAC object. 
The first instant must be of kind preventive. 
The second instant must be of kind outage.
