In the logs, the start and end of different steps are logged:  
- Start and end of the angle monitoring algorithm
- Start and end of the monitoring of each state (preventive or post-contingency)
- Start and end of each load-flow computation  

Also, the following information is logged:
- Applied remedial actions to relieve angle constraints
- At the end of each state monitoring, the list of remaining angle constraints
- At the end of the monitoring algorithm, the list of remaining angle constraints

**Example 1:**  
In this example, a curative constraint (after contingency "Co-1") induces the implementation of a CRA, but this CRA is 
not enough to solve the constraint.
