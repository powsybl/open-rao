FARAO stands for *Fully Autonomous Remedial Actions Optimisation*. It is an open-source toolbox that aims at providing a modular engine for remedial actions optimisation.

**farao-core** repository contains the main features of FARAO. It provides a command line tool to interact with these features.

For detailed information about FARAO toolbox, please refer to the [detailed documentation](https://farao-community.github.io/docs/).

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [FARAO Code of Conduct](https://github.com/farao-community/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine
for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

In order to build **farao-core**, you need the following environment available:
  - Install JDK *(11 or greater)*,
  - Install Maven latest version.

### Installing

Before installing **farao-core**, you need to install OR-Tools, a software suite for optimisation that is used by FARAO remedial actions optimiser.

Please refer to [OR-tools website](https://developers.google.com/optimization/install/download) for installation instructions.

To build **farao-core**, enter on the command line:

```
$> git clone https://github.com/farao-community/farao-core.git
$> cd farao-core
$> ./install.sh
```

FARAO also needs a loadflow engine and a sensitivity calculation engine at runtime.
You may use any engine integrated in [PowSyBl framework](https://www.powsybl.org/).

Hades2 tool from RTE is available as a freeware for demonstration purpose.
For more information about how to get and install Hades2 loadflow and sensitivity computation, please refer to the
[dedicated documentation](https://rte-france.github.io/hades2/index.html).

### Running

In order for FARAO to run without error, you will need to configure your *itools* platform. *itools* is a command line interface
provided by PowSyBl framework. 

Two options are available:
1.  First, you can use the one provided by FARAO. It is saved in the *etc* directory of the installation, and is called *config.yml*.
You just have to copy-paste it in **$HOME/.itools** directory. You can also use one of the provided network post-processor scripts 
saved in the *etc* directory by copy-pasting them in the same directory and adding these lines to your *config.yml* file :

```$yml
import:
  postProcessors: groovyScript

groovy-post-processor:
    script: $HOME/.itools/core-cc-ucte-postProcessor.groovy

``` 

2.  Expert users can also adapt it to their own needs.

For using *itools*, enter on the command line:
 
```bash
cd <install-prefix>/bin
./itools help
```

For more information about *itools*, do not hesitate to visit [PowSyBl documentation](https://www.powsybl.org/docs/).
